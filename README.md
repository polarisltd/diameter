Diameter Java Simulator Client/Server and Seagull Preprocessor

There are 3 projects in repository


<b>EmblaSeagullTool</b>

This is a preprocessor to Seagull.
<p>
Everyone thinks Seagull is cool and thats right at least because everyone uses it, at any site seriously working 
with diameter protocol one can hear name Seagull but life sometimes becomes boaring as editing manually .xml 
scenario file is really nasty activity. Plus if one needs to convert 3gpp timestamp into hex string or similar 
to get ip address in hex format. So this is a workaround to make use of seagull comfortable, at least for me.

<b>Prepaid Server Simulator</b>

This is a tool as name tells, it can be used to simulate diameter protocol for prepaid server.

This code is based on Mobicents gx/gy charging server simulator code used for sip servlets demo.

What is missing for me is simulation capabilities of CCR/CCA for proxied requests so if one needs to 
write test cases testing his diameter server that is to what earler or later one comes to
